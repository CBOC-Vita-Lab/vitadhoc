/* test_gb_rtc_utc.c -- the GB/GBC clock save's timestamp is UTC, and the
 * saves 3.5.0 and earlier stamped with local time still load without a jump
 * (frontend-common/fe_host.c "the clock trailer's stamp is
 * UTC").
 *
 * The production frontend (fe_host.c) boots a generated MBC3 clock
 * cartridge over a save file this test wrote, and the file it writes back is
 * read as another emulator would read it.  The test owns three things:
 *
 *   utc      the true time
 *   zone     how far the console's clock is ahead of UTC (its time zone)
 *   upgrade  the console's local time when it first ran a release that
 *            stamps UTC (CONFIG.INI gb_rtc_utc_since on the PSP)
 *
 * and plays the other parties itself: a UTC emulator (VBA-M, BGB, SameBoy,
 * mGBA) and GBAdhoc 3.5.0, which stamped the console's LOCAL time.  Every
 * case runs at eight zones from UTC-8 to UTC+13, two of them not whole
 * hours.  The clock is checked as elapsed seconds: an error of the zone
 * offset, which is what this is about, cannot hide.
