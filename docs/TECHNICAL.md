# Technical Notes

## Architecture

`gpsp/vita/Makefile` builds the native Vita app. gpSP supplies the GBA core
and ARM dynamic recompiler; TGB Dual supplies GB/GBC. The common frontend
owns cartridges, saves and link state. The Vita session loop is
`gpsp/vita/main_vita.c`, with separate network, local-pair, cheat, audio and
rendering modules. Host twins compile much of the same code for tests.

The Vita frontend reuses the PSP menu/settings logic through a compatibility
layer, but uses GXM/libvita2d, embedded Inter/Outfit fonts, Vita audio/input,
front touch and Vita networking. It does not run a PSP executable inside an
emulator. Original gpSP, GBAdhoc and dependency notices remain in the source.

## Display And Timing

- Per-console settings include 2x/3x, fit, stretch and 4x crop; nearest,
  bilinear, sharp bilinear, LCD, scanline, Scale3x and CPU xBRZ filters;
  colour correction and motion blending.
- Scale3x/xBRZ use worker cores, changed regions and a scrolling image cache.
  During heavy fades, smoothing can fall back to 2x inside existing textures.
- A GBA render worker draws from recorded scanline state. The main thread
  joins it before presentation. Two-player paths retain their own timing.
- Keep full speed can run up to two catch-up frames without drawing before
  a presented frame. Emulated frames, submitted pictures and actual displayed
  FPS are different measurements; a log counter alone is not a benchmark.
- Presentation waits before input sampling to avoid filling the display queue.
  Audio starts with a 60 ms cushion and can adapt up to 120 ms after underruns.
- Experimental GPU xBRZ is off by default: earlier Vita measurements were
  slower than CPU xBRZ. It needs the user's own shader compiler module and has
  a slow-frame fallback. No proprietary compiler is distributed.

GBA Wide view can draw beyond the original viewport using game profiles,
Mode 7 support or an experimental background cache/scout. Emerald has prior
testing; other profiles and generic/scout behaviour are not universally
accepted. Where information is unavailable, margins use the selected fallback.
It does not turn all games into native widescreen games or modify their saves.

## Version 1.0 Changes

Engineering detail behind the [What's New](../CHANGELOG.md) list.

**Features**
- **Sensor cartridges** (`gpsp/cart_sensor.h`, `gba_memory.c`, `gba_over.h`,
  `frontend-common/fe_sensor.h`, `gbcore/tgbdual/mbc.c`, `vita/plat_vita.c`
  SceMotion): Boktai's solar sensor, WarioWare: Twisted!'s gyro and the
  Yoshi / Koro Koro tilt sensor follow GBATEK's protocols; MBC7 latches the
  full 16-bit sample. One reading is published per frame and recorded in the
  rewind context, so rewound frames replay it. The sensor state rides in save
  states as an optional key; other games' states are unchanged. In a link the
  partner machine sees a still console in the dark.
- **Continue** (`vita/main_vita.c` resume_*): a state taken in memory on the
  frame thread when a game is left, every two minutes of play and 30 frames
  after an in-game save, written by the I/O worker as `Game.rsm` (temp, old
  aside, new in). `Game.rsm.pt` records the patch the point was made with, and
  a different patch refuses it.
- **Play log** (`vita/play_log.c`): `playlog.txt`, static tables, atomic
  saves; full at 2,048 games, the game played longest ago is forgotten.
- **Patches** (`vita/rom_patch.c`): IPS (with the truncation record), BPS
  (source, target and patch CRC checks) and UPS (either direction). The
  patched copy is cached in `patched/` with a key of sizes, times and the
  patch's CRC. `Game.gba.ips` names one cartridge; `Game.ips` is refused when
  another cartridge shares the name.
- **RetroAchievements** (`vita/ra_vita.c`, `vita/ra_http.c`, vendored
  rcheevos v12.5.0 with `RC_NO_THREADS`): the rc_client runs on the game
  thread; requests go one at a time to a network thread (HTTPS through
  SceHttp/SceSsl with the root certificates in `ra_roots.h`; plain HTTP over
  sockets for tests). The game's hash is the MD5 of the whole file (patched
  copy if patched), computed on that thread. Memory maps match rcheevos's
  console tables (`fe_host_ra_read`, `gbcore_ra_read`). Hardcore blocks every
  state load, rewind and cheats, and lifts for games with neither achievements
  nor leaderboards; Continue waits for that answer (20 s at most). Processing
  pauses during link play and progress resets after a state load, rewind or
  link. A sign-in that couldn't reach the server is retried. Unsent unlocks get
  three seconds at exit. The password goes through the IME in password mode,
  is sent once, and its buffers are wiped.
- **Per-game settings** (`psp/config_psp.c` pcfg_game_*): `games/<rom>.ini`.
- **Super Game Boy borders** (`gbcore/tgbdual/sgb.c` under `TGB_SGB_BORDER`):
  the border is composed into one 256x224 picture and kept in
  `borders/<rom>.sgb`, since GB states don't carry it.

**Fixes from review**
- TGB Dual's MBC7 EEPROM write-all stored both bytes of each word at one
  address (`LOCAL-PATCHES.md`).
- A reset Game Boy no longer saves a blank SGB border.
- The resume writer reports to the frame thread instead of logging from the
  I/O thread (the log has one producer).
- Library, artwork and save-safety work: one folder
  walk for all three consoles, kerning and text measuring cached, cover
  downloads resolved once per pass, Game Boy saves checked every second,
  temp-old-new writes for favourites and partner saves.

**Fixes from Vita testing**
- An MSR that sets the T bit now continues in Thumb at the next instruction,
  as on the ARM7TDMI (`cpu.cc` `cpsr_masks` and the interpreter; each
  backend's `execute_store_cpsr_body` returns the Thumb address and its stub
  resumes there). Packed start-up code depends on it: Pokémon Pinball: Ruby &
  Sapphire with an added intro ran off into data with the screen
  blanked.
- Code in palette RAM and OAM runs through the same uncached interpreter
  bridge as VRAM code (`cpu_threaded.c`, `GBA_PC_UNCACHED` in `cpu.h`; the
  interpreter fetches it with `read_memory`). The same intro's last
  trampoline runs at `0x050003F0`; before, it was treated as a bad jump and
  the game reset.
- The x86 dynarec gives an NV-condition instruction a jump to patch, as the
  ARM backend does (an ARM scan that met one first patched a NULL address).
- A game picked before its backdrop art was decoded used to decode it on the
  press: on a Vita, 7 s with the screen frozen, most of it 513 row writes of
  the 1 MiB cache file. The launch now takes the ambient colours from the
  cover's thumbnail (`launch_art_quick`, `psp/ui_psp.c`), and the cache file
  is written in one call.

**Tests:** host-twin app tests `sensors`, `resume`, `recent`, `patch`, `ra`
(against a stand-in server), `game_look` and `sgb`, and `cpufix` tests 9-11 (MSR into Thumb, code in
palette RAM and OAM, `testrom/cpufix.c`); unit tests
`tools/tests/test_cart_sensors.c`, `tools/tests/test_rom_patch.c`,
`gbcore/tests/mbc7.c` and `vita/tests/playlog/test_play_log.c` under ASan and
UBSan.

## Diagnostics

Switches include `drc = 0`, `render_thread = 2` for comparison,
`gpu_xbrz = 1` for experiments, `clips = 0` / `art = 0` to turn off optional
work, and `ra_host = http://host:port` for a test RetroAchievements server.
Logs under `ux0:data/GBAdhoc/log/` may contain ROM paths and network
addresses; review them before sharing. The package does not install a clock
or plugin profile. [Known Issues](../KNOWN-ISSUES.md) lists what still needs
a Vita.
