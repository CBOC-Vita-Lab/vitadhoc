/* mtm_driver.c -- the Media Engine MODULE's own code, run on the desktop.
 *
 * ME_TIMING_SIM (video_me_timing_sim.h) models the engine with the twin's own
 * build of video.cc and its own arrays.  It never runs psp/me/: not
 * me_render_glue.cc, not video.cc as the module compiles it (ME_PRX_BUILD),
 * not the work area the host hands over (psp/me/me_mbox.h).  This does.
 *
 * tools/e2e/me_module_twin/build.sh compiles the module's three renderer
 * sources for the desktop, exactly as psp/me/Makefile lists them, and renames
 * every symbol they define to mep_*, so a second, independent renderer sits
 * beside the twin's.  This file plays the host: for every frame the model
 * replays at the vcount-160 post it builds a real me_render_desc, posts
 * ME_CMD_RENDER through me_render_run(), and returns the hash of the stage
 * the module wrote.  video_me_timing_sim.h prints it as `mod=` on the MTS
 * line, and it must equal `vis=` on every frame.
 *
 * WHAT IS REAL.  The module's C: descriptor handling, the dirty-page patch of
 * its persistent VRAM mirror, the work-area pointers, the fresh-area rule,
 * the refusal, the log apply, the pitched write-out -- and the PSP's address
 * conventions, because the module computes with them: every buffer it is
 * given lives in one arena mapped twice, at 0x10000000 and again at
 * 0x50000000, so `addr | 0x40000000` (the uncached alias) and
 * `addr & ~0x40000000` (the cached one) name the same bytes, as on hardware.
 *
 * WHAT IS NOT.  It is x86 code from a desktop compiler, there are no caches
 * (the cache ops compile to nothing), and there is one CPU.  Whether the MIPS
 * module is correct, whether two cores with separate caches agree, and what
 * any of it costs are questions only a console answers.
 *
 * LIFECYCLE EVENTS (MTM_EVERY=N, default 0 = none): every N frames one of
 *   rebuild   the host rebuilt the renderer: new work_gen, area scrambled
 *   sleep     the area was lost and the ME reset, the host did NOT rebuild
 *             (power_cb teardown_skipped): same gen, me_render_boot()
 *   move      same gen, the area is somewhere else
 *   refuse    a desc with no work area, then the real one
 * `refuse` must leave the picture untouched.  The other three restart the
 * module from an empty area, which is what a freshly loaded module is: the
 * OBJ lists are empty until the game next writes OAM, so a few frames after
 * such an event may differ from the model -- the comparison script counts
 * them separately and they must stop.
 *
 * MTM_FAULT=stale is the oracle's own test: the dirty-page map is handed over
 * with every page marked clean, so the module's mirror goes stale.  A run
 * whose VRAM changes must then report mismatches and MTM_MIRROR lines; if it
 * does not, `mod_bad 0` means nothing. */
